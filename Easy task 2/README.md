I made this program in PYTHON because it made it easy and short;** and also i was getting errors in JAVA.**

1.Firstly we modify our lists a bit, i.e. we sort them; this makes sure that the diiference is always minimum and we get minimum number of moves to seat everyone.
2.Then we subtract x and y , where x and y are from seats and students lists, and then we sum up these values to get the desired result.
3.**Note:**   We used the "zip" function to convert seats and students into one single iterable object for the "for" loop.
